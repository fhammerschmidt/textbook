# Type Checking

Earlier, we skipped over the type checking phase.  Let's come back to
that now. After lexing and parsing, the next phase of compilation is
semantic analysis, and the primary task of semantic analysis is type
checking.

A *type system* is a mathematical description of how to determine
whether an expression is *ill typed* or *well typed*, and in the
latter case, what the type of the expression is.  A *type checker*
is a program that implements a type system, i.e., that implements
the static semantics of the language.

Commonly, a type system is formulated as a ternary relation 
$$\mathit{HasType}(\Gamma, e, t)$$, which means that expression
$$e$$ has type $$t$$ in typing context $$\Gamma$$.
A *typing context*, aka *typing environment*, is a map from
identifiers to types.  The context is used to record what variables
are in scope, and what their types are.  The use of the Greek letter
$$\Gamma$$ for contexts is traditional.

That ternary relation $$\mathit{HasType}$$ is typically written
with infix notation, though,
as $$\Gamma \vdash e : t$$.  You can read the turnstile symbol
$$\vdash$$ as "proves" or "shows", i.e., the context $$\Gamma$$
shows that $$e$$ has type $$t$$.

Let's make that notation a little friendlier by eliminating the Greek
and the math typesetting.  We'll just write `ctx |- e : t` to mean
that typing context `ctx` shows that `e` has type `t`.  Let's write
`{}` for the empty context, and `x:t` to mean that `x` is bound to `t`.
So, `{foo:int, bar:bool}` would be the context is which `foo`
has type `int` and `bar` has type `bool`.  A context may bind an
identifier at most once.  We'll write `ctx[x -> t]` to mean
a context that contains all the bindings of `ctx`, and also binds
`x` to `t`.  If `x` was already bound in `ctx`, then that old binding
is replaced by the new binding to `t` in `ctx[x -> t]`.

With all that machinery, we can at last define what it means to be well
typed: An expression `e` is **well typed** in context `ctx` if there
exists a type `t` for which `ctx |- e : t`. The goal of a type checker
is thus to find such a type `t`, starting from some initial context.

It's convenient to pretend that the initial context is empty. But in
practice, it's rare that a language truly uses the empty context to
determine whether a program is well typed. In OCaml, for example, there
are many built-in identifiers that are always in scope, such as
everything in the `Stdlib` module.
