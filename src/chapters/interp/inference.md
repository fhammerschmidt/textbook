# Type Inference

Java and OCaml are *statically typed* languages, meaning every binding has a
type that is determined at *compile time*&mdash;that is, before any part of the
program is executed. The type-checker is a compile-time procedure that either
accepts or rejects a program. By contrast, JavaScript and Ruby are
dynamically-typed languages; the type of a binding is not determined ahead of
time.  Computations like binding 42 to `x` and then treating `x` as a string
therefore either result in run-time errors, or run-time conversion between
types.

Unlike Java, OCaml is *implicitly typed*, meaning programmers rarely need to
write down the types of bindings. This is often convenient, especially with
higher-order functions. (Although some people disagree as to whether it makes
code easier or harder to read). But implicit typing in no way changes the fact
that OCaml is statically typed. Rather, the type-checker has to be more
sophisticated because it must infer what the *type annotations* "would have
been" had the programmers written all of them. In principle, type inference and
type checking could be separate procedures (the inferencer could figure out the
types then the checker could determine whether the program is well-typed), but
in practice they are often merged into a single procedure called *type
reconstruction*.

## OCaml type reconstruction

OCaml was rather cleverly designed so that type reconstruction is a
straightforward algorithm. At a very high level, that algorithm works as
follows:

-   Determine the types of definitions in order, using the types of earlier
    definitions to infer the types of later ones. (Which is one reason you may
    not use a name before it is bound in an OCaml program.)

-   For each `let` definition, analyze the definition to determine *constraints*
    about its type. For example, if the inferencer sees `x + 1`, it concludes
    that `x` must have type `int`. It gathers similar constraints for function
    applications, pattern matches, etc. Think of these constraints as a system
    of equations like you might have in algebra.

-   Use that system of equations to solve for the type of the name begin
    defined.

The OCaml type reconstruction algorithm attempts to never reject a program that
could type check, if the programmer had written down types. It also attempts
never to accept a program that cannot possibly type check. Some more obscure
parts of the language can sometimes make type annotations either necessary or at
least helpful (see *Real World OCaml* chapter 22, "Type inference", for
examples). But for most code you write, type annotations really are completely
optional.

Since it would be verbose to keep writing "the type reconstruction algorithm
used by OCaml and other functional languages," we'll call the algorithm HM. That
name is used throughout the programming languages literature, because the
algorithm was independently invented by Roger <u>H</u>indley and Robin
<u>M</u>ilner. In the next few sections, we'll see how HM works.

## The history of HM

HM has been rediscovered many times by many people. Curry used it
informally in the 1950's (perhaps even the 1930's). He wrote it up
formally in 1967 (published 1969). Hindley discovered it independently
in 1969; Morris in 1968; and Milner in 1978. In the realm of logic,
similar ideas go back perhaps as far as Tarski in the 1920's. Commenting
on this history, Hindley wrote,

## Efficiency of HM

Although we haven't seen the HM algorithm yet, you probably won't be surprised
to learn that it's usually very efficient&mdash;you've probably never had to
wait for the toplevel to print the inferred types of your programs. In practice,
it runs in approximately linear time. But in theory, there are some very strange
programs that can cause its running-time to blow up. (Technically, it's
exponential time.) For fun, try typing the following code in utop:

```
# let b = true;;
# let f0 = fun x -> x + 1;;
# let f = fun x -> if b then f0 else fun y -> x y;;
# let f = fun x -> if b then f else fun y -> x y;;
# let f = fun x -> if b then f else fun y -> x y;;
(* keep repeating that last line *)
```

You'll see the types get longer and longer, and eventually (around 20
repetitions or so) type inference will cause a significant delay.
