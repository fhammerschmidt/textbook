# Exercises

Many of these exercises rely on the 
<a href="/interp/simpl.zip" download target="_blank">
completed SimPL interpreter</a> as starter code.

## Parsing 

##### Exercise: parse [&#10029;] 

Run `make` in the SimPL interpreter implementation.  It will compile the
interpreter and launch utop.  Evaluate the following expressions.
Note what each returns.

* `parse "22"`
* `parse "1+2+3"`
* `parse "let x = 2 in 20+x"`

Also evaluate these expressions, which will raise exceptions.  Explain why
each one is an error, and whether the error occurs during parsing or lexing.

* `parse "3.14"`
* `parse "3+"`

&square;

##### Exercise: parser.ml and lexer.ml [&#10029;] 

Open `_build/parser.ml`, which is the module generated automatically
by menhir from `parser.mly`.  Skim through the file to appreciate not
having to write the parser yourself.

Also open `_build/lexer.ml`, which is the module generated
automatically by ocamllex from `lexer.mll`.  Skim through the file to
appreciate not having to write the lexer yourself.

&square;

##### Exercise: simpl ids [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Examine the definition of the `id` regular expression in the SimPL lexer.
Identify at least one way in which it differs from the definition of
OCaml identifiers.

&square;

##### Exercise: times parsing [&#10029;&#10029;] 

In the SimPL parser, the `TIMES` token is declared as having higher precedence 
than `PLUS`, and as being left associative.  Let's experiment with other choices.

* Evaluate `parse "1*2*3"`.  Note the AST.
  Now change the declaration of the associativity of `TIMES` in `parser.mly` to be 
  `%right` instead of `%left`.  Recompile and reevaluate `parse "1*2*3"`.  How did
  the AST change?  Before moving on, restore the declaration to be `%left`.
  
* Evaluate `parse "1+2*3"`.  Note the AST.
  Now swap the declaration `%left TIMES` in `parser.mly` with the declaration
  `%left PLUS`.  Recompile and reevaluate `parse "1+2*3"`.  How did
  the AST change?  Before moving on, restore the original declaration order.
  
&square;

## Type Checking

##### Exercise: infer [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Type inference for SimPL can be done in a much simpler way than for the larger
language (with anonymous functions and let expression) that we considered in the
section on type inference.

Run `make` in the SimPL interpreter implementation.  It will compile the
interpreter and launch utop.  Now, define a function `infer : string -> typ`
such that `infer s` parses `s` into an expression and infers the type of
`s` in the empty context.  Your solution will make use of the `typeof`
function.  You don't need constraint collection or unification.

Try out your `infer` function on these test cases:

* `"3110"`
* `"1 <= 2"`
* `"let x = 2 in 20 + x"`

##### Exercise: subexpression types [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Suppose that a SimPL expression is well typed in a context `ctx`.
Are all of its subexpressions also well typed in `ctx`?  For every
subexpression, does there exist some context in which the
subexpression is well typed? Why or why not?

&square;

##### Exercise: typing [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Use the SimPL type system to show that
`{} |- let x = 0 in if x <= 1 then 22 else 42 : int`.

&square;

## The Substitution Model

##### Exercise: substitution [&#10029;&#10029;] 

What is the result of the following substitutions?

  - `(x+1){2/x}` 
  - `(x+y){2/x}{3/y}`
  - `(x+y){1/z}`
  - `(let x=1 in x+1){2/x}`
  - `(x + (let x=1 in x+1)){2/x}`
  - `((let x=1 in x+1) + x){2/x}`
  - `(let x=y in x+1){2/y}`
  - `(let x=x in x+1){2/x}`
  
&square;

##### Exercise: step expressions [&#10029;] 

Here is an example of evaluating an expression:
```
  7+5*2
-->  (step * operation)
  7+10
-->  (step + operation)
  17
```
There are two steps in that example, and we've annotated each
step with a parenthetical comment to hint at which evaluation
rule we've used.  We stopped evaluating when we reached a value.

Evaluate the following expressions using the small-step substitution model.
Use the "long form" of evaluation that we demonstrated above, in which
you provide a hint as to which rule is applied at each step.

 - `(3 + 5) * 2` (2 steps)
 - `if 2 + 3 <= 4 then 1 + 1 else 2 + 2` (4 steps)
 
&square;

##### Exercise: step let expressions [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Evaluate these expressions, again using the "long form" from the
previous exercise.  

 - `let x = 2 + 2 in x + x` (3 steps)
 - `let x = 5 in ((let x = 6 in x) + x)` (3 steps)
 - `let x = 1 in (let x = x + x in x + x)` (4 steps)

&square;

##### Exercise: variants [&#10029;] 

Evaluate these Core OCaml expressions using the small-step 
substitution model:

 - `Left (1+2)` (1 step)
 - `match Left 42 with Left x -> x+1 | Right y -> y-1` (2 steps)
   
&square;


##### Exercise: application [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Evaluate these Core OCaml expressions using the small-step 
substitution model:

 - `(fun x -> 3 + x) 2` (2 steps)
 - `let f = (fun x -> x + x) in (f 3) + (f 3)` (6 steps)
 - `let f = fun x -> x + x in let x = 1 in let g = fun y -> x + f y in g 3` (7 steps)
 - `let f = (fun x -> fun y -> x + y) in let g = f 3 in (g 1) + (f 2 3)` (9 steps)

&square;

##### Exercise: omega [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Try evaluating `(fun x -> x x) (fun x -> x x)`.  This expression,
which is usually called $$\Omega$$,
doesn't type check in real OCaml, but we can still use the Core OCaml
small-step semantics on it.

## Pairs

Add pairs (i.e., tuples with exactly two components) to SimPL.
Start with the <a href="/interp/simpl.zip" download target="_blank">
base SimPL interpreter</a>

##### Exercise: pair parsing [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Implement lexing and parsing of pairs. Assume that the parentheses
around the pair are required (not optional, as they sometimes are in
OCaml).  Follow this strategy:

* Add a constructor for pairs to the `expr` type.
* Add a comma token to the parser.
* Implement lexing the comma token.
* Implement parsing of pairs.

When you compile, you will get some inexhaustive pattern match warnings,
because you have not yet implemented type checking nor interpretation of
pairs.  But you can still try parsing them in utop with the `parse`
function.

&square;

##### Exercise: pair type checking [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Implement type checking of pairs.  Follow this strategy:

* Write down a new typing rule before implementing any code.
* Add a new constructor for pairs to the `typ` type.
* Add a new branch to `typeof`.

&square;

##### Exercise: pair evaluation [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Implement evaluation of pairs.  Follow this strategy:

* Implement `is_value` for pairs.  A pair of values (e.g., `(0,1)`)
  is itself a value, so the function will need to become recursive.
* Implement `subst` for pairs:  `(e1, e2){v/x} = (e1{v/x}, e2{v/x})`.
* Implement small-step and big-step evaluation of pairs, using these 
  rules:

```
(e1, e2) --> (e1', e2)
  if e1 --> e1'

(v1, e2) --> (v1, e2')
  if e2 --> e2'
  
(e1, e2) ==> (v1, v2)
  if e1 ==> v1
  and e2 ==> v2
```

&square;

## Lists

Suppose we treat list expressions like syntactic sugar in the 
following way:

* `[]` is syntactic sugar for `Left 0`.
* `e1 :: e2` is syntactic sugar for `Right (e1, e2)`.

##### Exercise: desugar list [&#10029;] 

What is the core OCaml expression to which `[1;2;3]` desugars?

&square;

##### Exercise: list not empty [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a core OCaml function `not_empty` that returns `1` if a list
is non-empty and `0` if the list is empty.  Use the substitution 
model to check that your function behaves properly on these 
test cases:

 - `not_empty []`
 - `not_empty [1]`

&square;

## Pattern Matching [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

In core OCaml, there are only two patterns: `Left x` and `Right x`,
where `x` is a variable name.  But in full OCaml, patterns are far more
general. Let's see how far we can generalize patterns in core OCaml.

**Step 1:** Here is a BNF grammar for patterns, and slightly revised 
BNF grammar for expressions:

```
p ::= i | (p1, p2) | Left p | Right p | x | _

e ::= ... 
    | match e with | p1 -> e1 | p2 -> e2 | ... | pn -> en
```

In the revised syntax for `match`, only the very first `|` on the line,
immediately before the keyword `match`, is meta-syntax.  The remaining
four `|` on the line are syntax.  Note that we require `|` before the
first pattern.

**Step 2:** A value `v` matches a pattern `p` if by substituting any
variables or wildcards in `p` with values, we can obtain exactly `v`. 
For example:

* `2` matches `x` because `x{2/x}` is `2`.
* `Right(0,Left 0)` matches `Right(x,_)` because 
  `Right(x,_){0/x}{Left 0/_}` is `Right(0,Left 0)`.
  
Let's define a new ternary relation called `matches`, guided by those 
examples:
```
v =~ p // s
```
Pronounce this relation as "`v` matches `p` producing substitutions `s`."

Here, `s` is a sequence of substitutions, such as 
`{0/x}{Left 3/y}{(1,2)/z}`. There is just a single rule for this 
relation:
```
v =~ p // s
  if v = p s
```

For example, 
```
2 =~ x // {2/x}
  because 2 = x{2/x}
```

**Step 3:** To evaluate a match expression:

* Evaluate the expression being matched to a value.
* If that expression matches the first pattern, evaluate the expression 
  corresponding to that pattern.
* Otherwise, match against the second pattern, the third, etc.
* If none of the patterns matches, evaluation is *stuck*: it cannot 
  take any more steps.
  
Using those insights, complete the following evaluation rules
by filling in the places marked with `???`:

```
(* This rule should implement evaluation of e. *)
match e with | p1 -> e1 | p2 -> e2 | ... | pn -> en 
--> ???
  if ???

(* This rule implements moving past p1 to the next pattern. *)
match v with | p1 -> e1 | p2 -> e2 | ... | pn -> en 
--> match v with | p2 -> e2 | ... | pn -> en 
  if there does not exist an s such that ???
  
(* This rule implements matching v with p1 then proceeding to evaluate e1. *)
match v with | p1 -> e1 | p2 -> e2 | ... | pn -> en 
--> ??? (* something involving e1 *)
  if ???
```

Note that we don't need to write the following rule explicitly:
```
match v with |  -/->
```
Evaluation will get stuck at that point because none of the three other
rules above will apply.

**Step 4:** Double check your rules by evaluating the following 
expression:
`match (1 + 2, 3) with | (1,0) -> 4 | (1,x) -> x | (x,y) -> x + y`

## Recursion

One of the evaluation rules for `let` is
```
let x = v in e --> e{v/x}
```

We could try adapting that to `let rec`:
```
let rec x = v in e --> e{v/x}   (* broken *)
```
But that rule doesn't work properly, as we see in the following example:
```
  let rec fact = fun x ->
	if x <= 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1)) in
  fact 3

-->

  (fun x -> if x <= 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1)) 3

-->

  if 3 <= 1 then 1 else 3 * (fact (3 - 1))

--> 

  3 * (fact (3 - 1))

-->

  3 * (fact 2)

-/->
```
We're now stuck, because we need to evaluate `fact`, but it doesn't step.
In essence, the semantic rule we used "forgot" the function value that should
have been associated with `fact`.

A good way to fix this problem is to introduce a new language construct
for recursion called simply `rec`.  (Note that OCaml does not have any 
construct that corresponds directly to `rec`.)  Formally, we extend the 
syntax for expressions as follows:
```
e ::= ...
    | rec f -> e
```

and add the following evaluation rule:

```
rec f -> e  -->  e{(rec f -> e)/f}
```

The intuitive reading of this rule is that when evaluating
`rec f -> e`, we "unfold" `f` in the body of `e`.  For example,
here is an infinite loop coded with `rec`:
```
  rec f -> f

-->  (* step rec *)

  f{(rec f -> f)/f}
  
= (* substitute *)

  rec f -> f
  
--> (* step rec *)

  f{(rec f -> f)/f}

...
```

Now we can use `rec` to implement `let rec`.  Anywhere 
`let rec` appears in a program:
```
let rec f = e1 in e2
```
we *desugar* (i.e., rewrite) it to
```
let f = rec f -> e1 in e2
```
Note that the second occurrence of `f` (inside the `rec`) shadows the
first one. Going back to the `fact` example, its desugared version is

```
let fact = rec fact -> fun x ->
  if x <= 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1)) in
fact 3
```

##### Exercise: let rec [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Evaluate the following expression (17 steps, we think,
though it does get pretty tedious).
You may want to simplify your life by writing "F" in place of
`(rec fact -> fun x -> if x <= 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x-1)))`

```
let rec fact = fun x ->
  if x <= 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1)) in
fact 3
```

&square;

## Environment Model

In the small-step substitution model, evaluation of an expression was 
rather *list-like*: we could write an evaluation in a linear form
like `e --> e1 --> e2 --> ... --> en --> v`.  In the big-step environment
model, evaluation is instead rather *tree-like*:  evaluations have a
nested, recursive structure.  Here's an example:
```
<{}, (3 + 5) * 2> ==> 16          (op rule)
    because <{}, (3 + 5)> ==> 8   (op rule)
        because <{},3> ==> 3      (int const rule)
        and     <{},5> ==> 5      (int const rule)
        and 3+5 is 8
    and <{}, 2> ==> 2             (int const rule)
    and 8*2 is 16
```
We've used indentation here to show the shape of the tree, and we've labeled
each usage of one of the semantic rules.  

##### Exercise: simple expressions [&#10029;] 

Evaluate the following expressions using the big-step environment model.
Use the notation for evaluation that we demonstrated above, in which 
you provide a hint as to which rule is applied at each
node in the tree.

 - `110 + 3*1000` *hint: three uses of the constant rule, two uses of the op rule*
 - `if 2 + 3 < 4 then 1 + 1 else 2 + 2` *hint: five uses of constant, three uses of op, 
   one use of if(else)*
 
&square;

##### Exercise: let and match expressions [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Evaluate these expressions, continuing to use the tree notation,
and continuing to label each usage of a rule.

 - `let x=0 in 1` *hint: one use of let, two uses of constant*
 - `let x=2 in x+1` *hint: one use of let, two uses of constant, one use of op, one 
    use of variable*
 - `match Left 2 with Left x -> x+1 | Right x -> x-1` *hint: one use of match(left), 
   two uses of constant, one use of op, one use of variable*
 
&square;

##### Exercise: closures [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Evaluate these expressions:

 - `(fun x -> x+1) 2` *hint: one use of application, one use of anonymous function,
   two uses of constant, one use of op, one use of variable*
 - `let f = fun x -> x+1 in f 2` *hint: one use of let, one use of anonymous function,
   one use of application, two uses of variable, one use of op, two uses of constant*

&square;

##### Exercise: lexical scope and shadowing [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Evaluate these expressions:

 - `let x=0 in x + (let x=1 in x)` *hint: two uses of let, two uses of variable, 
   one use of op, two uses of constant*
 - `let x=1 in let f=fun y -> x in let x=2 in f 0` *hint: three uses of let, one use
   of anonymous function, one use of application, two uses of variable, three uses of constant*

&square;

##### Exercise: more evaluation [&#10029;&#10029;, optional]

Evaluate these:

 - `let x = 2 + 2 in x + x` 
 - `let x = 1 in let x = x + x in x + x` 
 - `let f = fun x -> fun y -> x + y in let g = f 3 in g 2` 
 - `let f = fst (let x = 3 in fun y -> x, 2) in f 0`

&square; 

## Dynamic scope

##### Exercise: dynamic scope [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Use dynamic scope to evaluate the following expression.  You do not
need to write down all of the evaluation steps unless you find it
helpful.  Compare your answer to the answer you would expect from a
language with lexical scope.

```
let x = 5 in
let f y = x + y in
let x = 4 in
f 3
```

&square; 

##### Exercise: more dynamic scope [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Use dynamic scope to evaluate the following expressions.
Compare your answers to the answers you would expect from a
language with lexical scope.

Expression 1:
```
let x = 5 in
let f y = x + y in
let g x = f x in
let x = 4 in
g 3
```

Expression 2:
```
let f y = x + y in
let x = 3 in
let y = 4 in
f 2
```

&square;

## Type inference

##### Exercise: constraints [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Show the derivation of the `env |- e : t -| C` relation for these expressions:

```
1. fun x -> ( + ) 1 x
2. fun b -> if b then false else true
3. fun x -> fun y -> if x <= y then y else x
```

&square;

##### Exercise: unify [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Use the unification algorithm to solve the following system of
constraints.  Your answer should be a *substitution*, in the sense that
the unification algorithm defines that term.

```
X = int
Y = X -> X
```

&square;

##### Exercise: unify more [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Use the unification algorithm to solve the following system of
constraints.  Your answer should be a *substitution*, in the sense that
the unification algorithm defines that term.

```
X -> Y = Y -> Z
     Z = U -> W
```

&square;


##### Exercise: infer apply [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Using the HM type inference algorithm, infer the type
of the following definition:
```
let apply f x = f x
```

Remember to go through these steps:

* desugar the definition entirely (i.e., construct an AST)
* collect constraints
* solve the constraints with unification

&square;

##### Exercise: infer double [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Using the HM type inference algorithm, infer the type
of the following definition:
```
let double f x = f (f x)
```

&square;

##### Exercise: infer S [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Using the HM type inference algorithm, infer the type
of the following definition:
```
let s x y z = (x z) (y z)
```

&square;
