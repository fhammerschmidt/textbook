# Summary

Mutable data types make programs harder to reason about. For example, before
refs, we didn't have to worry about aliasing in OCaml. But mutability does have
its uses. I/O is fundamentally about mutation. And some data structures (like
arrays and hash tables) cannot be implemented as efficiently without mutability.

Mutability thus offers great power, but with great power comes great
responsibility. Try not to abuse your new-found power!
