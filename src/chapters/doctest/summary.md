# Summary

Documentation and testing are crucial to establishing the truth of what a
correct program does. Documentation communicates to other humans the intent of
the programmer. Testing communicates evidence about the success of the
programmer.

Good documentation provides several pieces:  a summary, preconditions,
postconditions (including errors), and examples.  Documentation is written
for two different audiences, clients and maintainers.  The latter needs
to know about abstraction functions and representation invariants.

Testing methodologies include black-box, glass-box, and randomized tests. These
are complementary, not orthogonal, approaches to developing correct code.
