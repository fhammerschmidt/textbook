# About This Book

**Reporting Errors.** If you find an error, please report it! Or if you have a
suggestion about how to rewrite some part of the book, let us know. Just go to
the page of the book for which you'd like to make a suggestion, click on the
Github icon (it looks like a cat) near the top right of the page, and click
"open issue" or "suggest edit". The latter is a little heavier weight, because
it requires you to fork the textbook repository with Github. But for minor edits
that will be appreciated and lead to much quicker uptake of suggestions.

**Videos.** You will find about 200 YouTube videos embedded throughout this
book. The videos usually provide an introduction to material, upon which the
textbook then expands. These videos were produced during pandemic when the
Cornell course that uses this textbook, CS 3110, had to be asynchronous. The
student response to them was overwhelmingly positive, so they are now being made
public as part of the textbook. But just so you know, they were not produced by
a professional A/V team&mdash;just a guy in his basement who was learning as he
went.

The videos mostly use the versions of OCaml and its ecosystem that were current
in Fall 2020. Current versions you are using are likely to look different from
the videos, but don't be alarmed: the underlying ideas are the same. The most
visible difference is likely to be the VS Code plugin for OCaml. In Fall 2020
the badly-aging "OCaml and Reason IDE" plugin was still being used. It has since
been superseded by the "OCaml Platform" plugin.

The order that the textbook covers topics sometimes differs from the order that
the videos cover the topics, simply because the videos originate from lectures.
The videos are placed in the textbook nearest to the topic they cover, but that
does mean sometimes the videos are not in chronological order.

**Collaborative Annotations.** At the right margin of each page, you will find
an annotation feature provided by [hypothes.is][hypothesis]. You can use this to
highlight and make private notes as you study the text. You can form study
groups to share your annotations, or share them publicly. Check out these
[tips for how to annotate effectively][tips].

**Executable Code.** Many pages of this book have OCaml code embedded in them.
The output of that code is already shown in the book. Here's an example:

```{code-cell} ocaml
print_endline "Hello world!"
```

You can also edit and re-run the code yourself to experiment and check your
understanding.  Look for the icon near the top right of the page that looks
like a rocket ship.  In the drop-down menu you'll find two ways to interact
with the code:

- *Binder* will launch the site [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), which is a
  free cloud-based service for "reproducible, interactive, sharable environments
  for science at scale." All the computation happens in their cloud servers, but
  the UI is provided through your browser. It will take a little while for the
  textbook page to open in Binder. Once it does, you can edit and run the code
  in a [*Jupyter notebook*][jupyter]. Jupyter notebooks are documents (usually
  ending in the `.ipynb` extension) that can be viewed in web browsers and used
  to write narrative content as well as code. They became popular in data
  science communities (especially Python, R, and Julia) as a way of sharing
  analyses. Now many languages can run in Jupyter notebooks, including OCaml.
  Code and text are written in *cells* in a Jupyter notebook. Look at the "Cell"
  menu in it for commands to run cells. Note that Shift-Enter is usually a
  hotkey for running the cell that has focus.

- *Live code* will actually do about the same thing, except that instead of
  leaving the current textbook page and taking you off to Binder, it will modify
  the code cells on the page to be editable. It takes some time for the
  connection to be made behind the scenes, during which you will see "Waiting
  for kernel". After the connection has been made, you can edit all the code
  cells on the page and re-run them.

Try interacting with the cell above now to make it print a string of your choice.
How about: `"Camels are bae."`

```{tip}
When you write "real" OCaml code, this is not the interface you'll be using.
You'll write code in an editor such as Visual Studio Code or Emacs, and you'll
compile it from a terminal. Binder and Live Code are just for interacting in a
seamless with the textbook.
```

**Downloadable Pages.** Each page of this book is downloadable in a variety of
formats. The download icon is at the top right of each page. You'll always find
the original source code of the page, which is usually [Markdown][md]&mdash;or
more precisely [MyST Markdown][myst], which is an extension of Markdown for
technical writing. Each page is also individually available as PDF, which simply
prints from your browser. For the entire book as a PDF, see the paragraph about
that below.

Pages with OCaml code cells embedded in them can also be downloaded as Jupyter
notebooks. To run those locally on your own machine (instead of in the cloud on
Binder), you'll need to install Jupyter. The easiest way of doing that is
typically to install [Anaconda][anaconda]. Then you'll need to install
[OCaml Jupyter][ocaml-jupyter], which requires that you already have OCaml
installed. To be clear, there's no need to install Jupyter or to use notebooks.
It's just another way to interact with this textbook beyond reading it.

**Exercises and Solutions.** At the end of each chapter except the first, you
will find a section of exercises. The exercises are annotated with a difficulty
rating:

* One star [&starf;]: easy exercises that should take only a minute or two.

* Two stars [&starf;&starf;]: straightforward exercises that should take a few
  minutes.

* Three stars [&starf;&starf;&starf;]: exercises that might require anywhere
  from five to twenty minutes or so.

* Four [&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;] or more stars: challenging or
  time-consuming exercises provided for students who want to dig deeper into the
  material.

It's possible we've misjudged the difficulty of a problem from time to time. Let
us know if you think an annotation is off.

Please do not post your solutions to the exercises anywhere, especially not in
public repositories where they could be found by search engines. {{ solutions }}

**PDF.** A <a href="../../ocaml_programming.pdf">full PDF version of this
book</a> is available. It does not contain the embedded videos, annotations, or
other features that the HTML version has. It might also have typesetting errors.
At this time, no tablet (ePub, etc.) version is available, but most tablets will
let you import PDFs.
