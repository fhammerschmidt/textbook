# Exercises

##### Exercise: list expressions [&#10029;] 

* Construct a list that has the integers 1 through 5 in it.  Use the square bracket 
  notation for lists.
  
* Construct the same list, but do not use the square bracket notation.  Instead use
  `::` and `[]`.

* Construct the same list again.  This time, the following expression must appear
  in your answer:  `[2;3;4]`.  Use the `@` operator, and do not use `::`.



##### Exercise: product [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function that returns the product of all the elements in a list.  The 
product of all the elements of an empty list is `1`.  *Hint: recall the `sum`
function we defined in lecture.*  


##### Exercise: concat [&#10029;&#10029;, optional]

Write a function that concatenates all the strings in a list.
The concatenation of all the strings in an empty list is the empty string `""`.
*Hint: this function is really not much different than `sum` or `product`.*



##### Exercise: product test [&#10029;&#10029;, optional] 

Unit test the function `product` that you wrote in an exercise above.



##### Exercise: patterns [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Using pattern matching, write three functions, one for each of the following
properties.  Your functions should return `true` if the input list
has the property and `false` otherwise.

* the list's first element is `"bigred"`
* the list has exactly two or four elements; do not use the `length` function
* the first two elements of the list are equal



##### Exercise: library [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Consult the [`List` standard library][listdoc] to solve these exercises:

* Write a function that takes an `int list` and returns the fifth element of that list, if such an element
  exists.  If the list has fewer than five elements, return `0`.  *Hint:  `List.length` and
  `List.nth`.*
  
* Write a function that takes an `int list` and returns the list sorted in descending order.
  *Hint: `List.sort` with `Stdlib.compare` as its first argument, and `List.rev`.*

##### Exercise: library test [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;, optional] 

Write a couple OUnit unit tests for each of the functions you wrote in the 
previous exercise.



##### Exercise: library puzzle [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

* Write a function that returns the last element of a list. Your
function may assume that the list is non-empty.  *Hint: Use two library functions, 
and do not write any pattern matching code of your own.* 

* Write a function `any_zeroes : int list -> bool` that returns `true`
if and only if the input list contains at least one `0`. *Hint: use one library function, 
and do not write any pattern matching code of your own.* 

Your solutions will be only one or two lines of code each.



##### Exercise: take drop [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

* Write a function `take : int -> 'a list -> 'a list` such that `take n lst` returns
the first `n` elements of `lst`.  If `lst` has fewer than `n` elements, return all
of them.  

* Write a function `drop : int -> 'a list -> 'a list` such that `drop n lst` 
returns all but the first `n` elements of `lst`.  If `lst` has fewer than `n` elements,
return the empty list.



##### Exercise: take drop tail [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;, recommended] 

Revise your solutions for `take` and `drop` to be tail recursive, if
they aren't already.  Test them on long lists with large values of `n`
to see whether they run out of stack space. Here is (tail-recursive) 
code to produce a long list:
```
(* returns:  [from i j l] is the list containing the integers from
 *   [i] to [j], inclusive, followed by the list [l].
 * example:  [from 1 3 [0] = [1;2;3;0]] *)
let rec from i j l =
  if i > j then l
  else from i (j - 1) (j :: l)

(* returns:  [i -- j] is the list containing the integers from
 *   [i] to [j], inclusive.
 *) 
let (--) i j =
  from i j []

let longlist = 0 -- 1_000_000
```
It would be worthwhile to study the definition of `--` to convince yourself
that you understand (i) how it works and (ii) why it is tail recursive.

 

##### Exercise: unimodal [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function `is_unimodal : int list -> bool` that takes an integer list and 
returns whether that list is unimodal.   A *unimodal list* is a list that 
monotonically increases to some maximum value then monotonically decreases 
after that value. Either or both segments (increasing or decreasing) may be empty.
A constant list is unimodal, as is the empty list.

 

##### Exercise: powerset [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;]

Write a function `powerset : int list -> int list list` that takes a set *S* 
represented as a list and returns the set of all subsets of *S*.  The order
of subsets in the powerset and the order of elements in the subsets do not matter.

*Hint:* Consider the recursive structure of this problem. 
Suppose you already have `p`, such
that `p = powerset s`. How could you use `p` to compute `powerset (x::s)`?

 
##### Exercise: print int list rec [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function `print_int_list : int list -> unit` that
prints its input list, one number per line.  For example,
`print_int_list [1;2;3]` should result in this output:
```
1
2
3
```
Here is some code to get you started:
```
let rec print_int_list = function 
| [] -> () 
| h::t -> (* fill in here *); 
          print_int_list t
```

&square;



##### Exercise: print int list iter [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function `print_int_list' : int list -> unit` whose
specification is the same as `print_int_list`.  Do not
use the keyword `rec` in your solution, but instead to use
the [List module][list] function `List.iter`.
Here is some code to get you started:
```
let print_int_list' lst = 
  List.iter (fun x -> (* fill in here *)) lst
```

&square;



##### Exercise: student [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Assume the following type definition:

```
type student = { first_name : string ; last_name : string ; gpa : float }
```
Give OCaml expressions that have the following types:

* `student`
* `student -> string * string`  (a function that extracts the student's name)
* `string -> string -> float -> student`  (a function that creates a student record)



##### Exercise: pokerecord [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Here is a variant that represents a few Pok&eacute;mon types:
```
type poketype = Normal | Fire | Water
```

* Define the type `pokemon` to be a record with fields `name` (a string),
  `hp` (an integer), and `ptype` (a `poketype`).

* Create a record named `charizard` of type `pokemon` that represents
a Pok&eacute;mon with 78 HP and Fire type.

* Create a record named `squirtle` of type `pokemon` that represents
a Pok&eacute;mon with 44 HP and Water type.



##### Exercise: safe hd and tl [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function `safe_hd : 'a list -> 'a option` that returns
`Some x` if the head of the input list is `x`, and `None` if the input list is
empty.

Also write a function `safe_tl : 'a list -> 'a list option` that returns
the tail of the list, or `None` if the list is empty.



##### Exercise: pokefun [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function `max_hp : pokemon list -> pokemon option` that, given a list of
`pokemon`, finds the Pok&eacute;mon with the highest HP.



##### Exercise: date before [&#10029;&#10029;] 

Define a *date-like triple* to be a value of type `int*int*int`.
Examples of date-like triples include `(2013, 2, 1)` and `(0,0,1000)`. A
*date* is a date-like triple whose first part is a positive year (i.e.,
a year in the common era), second part is a month between 1 and 12, and
third part is a day between 1 and 31 (or 30, 29, or 28, depending on the
month and year). `(2013, 2, 1)` is a date; `(0,0,1000)` is not.

Write a function `is_before` that takes two dates as input and evaluates
to `true` or `false`. It evaluates to `true` if the first argument is a
date that comes before the second argument. (If the two dates are the
same, the result is `false`.)

Your function needs to work correctly only for dates, not for arbitrary
date-like triples.  However, you will probably find it easier to write
your solution if you think about making it work for arbitrary date-like
triples. For example, it's easier to forget about whether the input is
truly a date, and simply write a function that claims (for example) that
January 100, 2013 comes before February 34, 2013&mdash;because any date
in January comes before any date in February, but a function that says
that January 100, 2013 comes after February 34, 2013 is also valid.  You
may ignore leap years.



##### Exercise: earliest date [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] 

Write a function `earliest : (int*int*int) list -> 
(int*int*int) option`. It evaluates to
`None` if the input list is empty, and to `Some d` if date `d` 
is the earliest date in the list.  *Hint: use `is_before`.*

As in the previous exercise, your function needs to work correctly 
only for dates, not for arbitrary date-like triples.



##### Exercise: assoc list [&#10029;]

Use the functions `insert` and `lookup` above to construct an 
association list that maps the integer 1 to the string "one", 
2 to "two", and 3 to "three".  Lookup the key 2.  Lookup the key 4.



##### Exercise: cards [&#10029;&#10029;]  

* Define a variant type `suit` that represents the four suits, &clubs;
&diams; &hearts; &spades;, in a [standard 52-card deck][cards].  All the
constructors of your type should be constant.

* Define a type `rank` that represents the possible ranks of a card:  2,
3, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace.  There are many possible
solutions; you are free to choose whatever works for you. One is to make
`rank` be a synonym of `int`, and to assume that Jack=11, Queen=12,
King=13, and Ace=1 or 14. Another is to use variants.

* Define a type `card` that represents the suit and rank of a single
card.  Make it a record with two fields.

* Define a few values of type `card`:  the Ace of Clubs, the Queen of Hearts,
the Two of Diamonds, the Seven of Spades.

##### Exercise: matching [&#10029;]  

For each pattern in the list below, give a value of type
`int option list` that does *not* match the pattern and is
not the empty list, or explain why that's impossible.

 - `(Some x)::tl`
 - `[Some 3110; None]`
 - `[Some x; _]`
 - `h1::h2::tl`
 - `h :: tl`
 


##### Exercise: quadrant [&#10029;&#10029;]  

<image style="float: right;"
       src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg/300px-Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg.png"
       alt="Quadrant 1: x, and y both positive.  Quadrant 2: x negative, y positive.  Quadrant 3: both x and y negative.  Quadrant 4: x positive, y negative."
       />

Complete the `quadrant` function below, which should return the quadrant
of the given `x, y` point according to the diagram on the right (borrowed from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg)).
Points that lie on an axis do not belong to any quandrant. *Hints: (a) define a helper function
for the sign of an integer, (b) match against a pair.* 

```
type quad = I | II | III | IV
type sign = Neg | Zero | Pos

let sign (x:int) : sign = 
  ...

let quadrant : int*int -> quad option = fun (x,y) ->
  match ... with
    | ... -> Some I
    | ... -> Some II
    | ... -> Some III
    | ... -> Some IV
    | ... -> None
```



##### Exercise: quadrant when [&#10029;&#10029;]  

Rewrite the quadrant function to use the `when` syntax.  You won't need
your helper function from before.

```
let quadrant_when : int*int -> quad option = function
    | ... when ... -> Some I
    | ... when ... -> Some II
    | ... when ... -> Some III
    | ... when ... -> Some IV
    | ... -> None
```

##### Exercise: depth [&#10029;&#10029;]  

Write a function `depth : 'a tree -> int` that returns the number of
nodes in any longest path from the root to a leaf.  For example, the
depth of an empty tree (simply `Leaf`) is `0`, and the depth of tree `t`
above is `3`. *Hint: there is a library function `max : 'a -> 'a -> 'a`
that returns the maximum of any two values of the same type.*



##### Exercise: shape [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;]  

Write a function `same_shape : 'a tree -> 'b tree -> bool` that determines whether
two trees have the same shape, regardless of whether the values they carry at each node
are the same. *Hint: use a pattern match with three branches, where the expression
being matched is a pair of trees.*



##### Exercise: list max exn [&#10029;&#10029;]  

Write a function `list_max : int list -> int`
that returns the maximum integer in a list, or raises 
`Failure "list_max"` if the list is empty.



##### Exercise: list max exn string [&#10029;&#10029;]  

Write a function `list_max_string : int list -> string`
that returns a string containing the maximum integer in a list, or 
the string `"empty"` (note, not the exception `Failure "empty"` but 
just the string `"empty"`) if the list is empty.  *Hint: `string_of_int` in
the standard library will do what its name suggests.*  



##### Exercise: list max exn ounit [&#10029;]  

Write two OUnit tests to determine whether your solution to **list max exn**, above,
correctly raises an exception when its input is the empty list, and whether it
correctly returns the max value of the input list when that list is nonempty.



##### Exercise: is_bst [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;]  

Write a function `is_bst : ('a*'b) tree -> bool` that returns `true` if
and only if the given tree satisfies the binary search tree invariant. 
An efficient version of this function that visits each node at most once
is somewhat tricky to write.
*Hint: write a recursive helper function that takes a tree and either
gives you (i) the minimum and maximum value in the tree, or (ii) tells
you that the tree is empty, or (iii) tells you that the tree does not
satisfy the invariant. Your `is_bst` function will not be recursive, but
will call your helper function and pattern match on the result.  You
will need to define a new variant type for the return type of your helper
function.*



##### Exercise: quadrant poly [&#10029;&#10029;]  

Modify your definition of quadrant to use polymorphic variants.  The
types of your functions should become these:
```
val sign : int -> [> `Neg | `Pos | `Zero ]
val quadrant : int * int -> [> `I | `II | `III | `IV ] option
```
