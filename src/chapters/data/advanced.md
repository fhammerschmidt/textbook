# Advanced Data Types

In this section, we study some OCaml data types that are unlikely
to be as familiar from other languages.  For that reason, we
call them *advanced.*  They include:

- **options**, which are loosely related to `null` in Java;
- **association lists**, which are an amazingly simple implementation
  of maps (aka dictionaries) based on lists and tuples;
- **algebraic data types**, which are arguably the most important
  kind of type in OCaml, and indeed are the power behind many
  of the other built-in types; and
- **exceptions**, which are a special kind of algebraic data type.
