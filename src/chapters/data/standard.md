# Standard Data Types

In the first half of this chapter, we study data types that OCaml
has built-in and are likely to feel familiar from many other
languages.  Because of that familiarity, we call them *standard*
data types.  They include:

- **lists** and **tuples**, which might feel similar to Python;
- **records** and **variants**, which might feel similar to 
  `struct` and `enum` types from C or Java.
  
We also take a detour into unit testing.
