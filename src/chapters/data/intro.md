# Data

In this chapter, we'll examine some of OCaml's built-in data types,
including lists, variants, records, tuples, and options.  Many of
those are likely to feel familiar from other programming languages.
We'll learn about *pattern matching*, which is a feature that's
less likely to be familiar.

Then we will see how we can define our own *algebraic data types*,
and how many of OCaml's built-in data types would not have to be
built-in, but are actually definable with algebraic data types.

We'll also examine how to define data types for trees and maps using
various combinations of the above features.
