# Implementing Callbacks

When a callback is registered with `bind` or one of the other syntaxes,
it is added to a list of callbacks that is stored with the promise.
Eventually, when the promise has been resolved, the Lwt *resolution
loop* runs the callbacks registered for the promise.  There is no
guarantee about the execution order of callbacks for a promise.  In
other words, the execution order is nondeterministic. If the order
matters, the programmer needs to use the composition operators (such as
`bind` and `join`) to enforce an ordering.  If the promise never becomes
resolved (or is rejected), none of its callbacks will ever be run.

Once again, it's important to keep track of where the concurrency really
comes from: the OS.  There might be many asynchronous I/O operations
occurring at the OS level.  But at the OCaml level, the resolution loop
is sequential, meaning that only one callback can ever be running
at a time.  

Finally, the resolution loop never attempts to interrupt a callback.
So if the callback goes into an infinite loop, no other callback will
ever get to run.  That makes Lwt a cooperative concurrency mechanism,
rather than preemptive.

## Our Own Callbacks

To better understand callback resolution, let's implement it ourselves.
We'll use the `Promise` data structure we developed earlier.
To start, we add a bind operator to the `Promise` signature:

```
module type Promise = sig 
  ...
  
  (** [p >>= c] registers callback [c] with promise [p]. 
      When the promise is resolved, the callback will be run
      on the promises's contents.  If the promise is never
      resolved, the callback will never run. *)
  val (>>=) : 'a promise -> ('a -> 'b promise) -> 'b promise
end
```

Next, let's re-develop the entire `Promise` structure.  We start
off just like before:

```
module Promise : Promise = struct
  type 'a state = Pending | Resolved of 'a | Rejected of exn
  ...
```

But now to implement the representation type of promises, we use
a record with mutable fields.  The first field is the state
of the promise, and it corresponds to the `ref` we used before.
The second field is more interesting and is discussed below.
```
  (** RI: the input may not be [Pending] *)
  type 'a handler = 'a state -> unit

  (** RI: if [state <> Pending] then [handlers = []]. *)
  type 'a promise = {
    mutable state : 'a state;
    mutable handlers : 'a handler list
  }
```
A *handler* is a new abstraction:  a function that takes a non-pending
state.  It will be used to handle resolving and rejecting promises when
their state is ready to switch away from pending.  The primary use for a
handler will be to run callbacks. As a representation invariant, we
require that only pending promises may have handlers waiting in their
list.  Once the state becomes non-pending, i.e., either resolved or
rejected, the handlers will all be processed and removed from the list.

This helper function that enqueues a handler on a promise's handler list
will be helpful later:
```
  let enqueue 
      (handler : 'a state -> unit) 
      (promise : 'a promise) : unit 
    =
    promise.handlers <- handler :: promise.handlers
```

We continue to pun resolvers and promises internally:
```
  type 'a resolver = 'a promise
```

Because we changed the representation type from a `ref` to a record,
we have to update a few of the functions in trivial ways:
```
  (** [write_once p s] changes the state of [p] to be [s].  If [p] and [s]
      are both pending, that has no effect.
      Raises: [Invalid_arg] if the state of [p] is not pending. *)
  let write_once p s = 
    if p.state = Pending
    then p.state <- s
    else invalid_arg "cannot write twice"

  let make () = 
    let p = {state = Pending; handlers = []} in
    p, p

  let return x = 
    {state = Resolved x; handlers = []}

  let state p = p.state
```

Now we get to the trickier parts of the implementation.  To resolve
or reject a promise, the first thing we need to do is to call
`write_once` on it, as we did before.  Now we also need
to process the handlers.  Before doing so, we mutate
the handlers list to be empty to ensure that the RI holds.
```
  (** requires: [st] may not be [Pending] *)
  let resolve_or_reject (r : 'a resolver) (st : 'a state) = 
    assert (st <> Pending);
    let handlers = r.handlers in
    r.handlers <- [];
    write_once r st;
    List.iter (fun f -> f st) handlers

  let reject r x = 
    resolve_or_reject r (Rejected x)

  let resolve r x =  
    resolve_or_reject r (Resolved x)    
```

Finally, the implementation of `>>=` is the trickiest part.
First, if the promise is already resolved, let's go ahead
and immediately run the callback on it:
```
  let (>>=) 
      (input_promise : 'a promise) 
      (callback : 'a -> 'b promise) : 'b promise 
    = 
    match input_promise.state with
    | Resolved x -> callback x
```
Second, if the promise is already rejected, then we return a promise
that is rejected with the same exception:
```
    | Rejected exc -> {state = Rejected exc; handlers = []}
```
Third, if the promise is pending, we need to do more work.
Here's what we said in our discussion of `bind` in the 
previous section:

> [T]he bind function returns a new promise. That promise will become 
resolved when (or if) the callback completes running, sometime in the 
future. Its contents will be whatever contents are contained within 
the promise that the callback itself returns.

That's what we now need to implement.  So,
we create a new promise and resolver called `output_promise` and
`output_resolver`.  That promise is what `bind` returns.  Before
returning it, we use a helper function `handler_of_callback` (described
below) to transform the callback into a handler, and enqueue that
handler on the promise.  That ensures the handler will be run
when the promise later becomes resolved or rejected:
```
    | Pending -> 
      let output_promise, output_resolver = make () in
      enqueue (handler_of_callback callback output_resolver) input_promise;
      output_promise
```

All that's left is to implement that helper function to create handlers
from callbacks.  The first two cases, below, are simple.  It would violate
the RI to call a handler on a pending state.  And if the state is rejected,
then the handler should propagate that rejection to the resolver, which
causes the promise returned by bind to also be rejected.
```
  let handler_of_callback 
      (callback : 'a -> 'b promise) 
      (resolver : 'b resolver) : 'a handler 
    = function
      | Pending -> failwith "handler RI violated"
      | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc
```
But if the state is resolved, then the callback provided by the user to bind
can&mdash;at last!&mdash;be run on the contents of the resolved promise.
Running the callback produces a new promise.  It might already be
rejected or resolved, in which case that state again propagates.  
```      
      | Resolved x ->
        let promise = callback x in
        match promise.state with
        | Resolved y -> resolve resolver y
        | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc
```
But the promise might still be pending.  In that case, we need to enqueue
a new handler whose purpose is to do the propagation once the result is
available:
```        
        | Pending -> enqueue (handler resolver) promise
```
where `handler` is a new helper function that creates a very simple handler
to do that propagation:
```
  let handler (resolver : 'a resolver) : 'a handler
    = function
      | Pending -> failwith "handler RI violated"
      | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc
      | Resolved x -> resolve resolver x
```      

The complete implementation of bind is thus as follows:
```
  let handler (resolver : 'a resolver) : 'a handler
    = function
      | Pending -> failwith "handler RI violated"
      | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc
      | Resolved x -> resolve resolver x

  let handler_of_callback 
      (callback : 'a -> 'b promise) 
      (resolver : 'b resolver) : 'a handler 
    = function
      | Pending -> failwith "handler RI violated"
      | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc
      | Resolved x ->
        let promise = callback x in
        match promise.state with
        | Resolved y -> resolve resolver y
        | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc
        | Pending -> enqueue (handler resolver) promise      

  let (>>=) 
      (input_promise : 'a promise) 
      (callback : 'a -> 'b promise) : 'b promise 
    = 
    match input_promise.state with
    | Resolved x -> callback x
    | Rejected exc -> {state = Rejected exc; handlers = []}
    | Pending -> 
      let output_promise, output_resolver = make () in
      enqueue (handler_of_callback callback output_resolver) input_promise;
      output_promise
```      

The Lwt implementation of `bind` follows essentially the same algorithm as 
we just implemented.  Note that there is no concurrency in `bind`: as
we said above, everything in Lwt is sequential; it's the OS that provides
the concurrency.
