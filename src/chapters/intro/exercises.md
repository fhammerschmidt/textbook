# Exercises

Future chapters of this textbook contain exercises as the final section. The
exercises are annotated with a difficulty rating:

* One star [&#10029;]:  easy exercises that should take only a minute or two.

* Two stars [&#10029;&#10029;]: straightforward exercises that should take a few  
  minutes.
  
* Three stars [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;]: exercises that might require anywhere
  from five to twenty minutes or so.  

* Four [&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;] or more stars: challenging or
  time-consuming exercises provided for students who want to dig deeper into the
  material.

Some exercises are annotated "advanced" or "optional". It's possible we've
misjudged the difficulty of a problem from time to time. Let us know if you
think an annotation is off.

Please do not post your solutions to the exercises anywhere, especially not in
public repositories where they could be found by search engines. A repository of
solutions is available to current students in the course. Instructions for how
to access it will be provided elsewhere. Instructors from other universities may
also request access.
