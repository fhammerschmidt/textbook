# Operators as Functions

The addition operator `+` has type `int->int->int`. It is normally
written *infix*, e.g., `3 + 4`. By putting parentheses around it, we can
make it a *prefix* operator: 

```
# ( + );;
- : int -> int -> int = <fun>

# ( + ) 3 4;;
- : int = 7

# let add3 = ( + ) 3;;
- : int -> int = <fun>

# add3 2;;
- : int = 5
```

The same technique works for any built-in operator. 

Normally the spaces are unnecessary. We could write `(+)` or `( + )`, but
it is idiomatic to include them. Beware of multiplication, which *must* be
written as `( * )`, because `(*)` would be parsed as beginning a comment.

We can even define our own new infix operators, for example:
```
let ( ^^ ) x y = max x y
```
And now `2 ^^ 3` evaluates to `3`.

The rules for which punctuation can be used to create infix operators are not
necessarily intuitive. Nor is the relative precedence with which such operators
will be parsed. So be careful with this usage.
