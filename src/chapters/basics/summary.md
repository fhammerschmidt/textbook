# Summary

Syntax and semantics are a powerful paradigm for learning a programming
language. As we learn the features of OCaml, we're being careful to write down
their syntax and semantics. We've seen that there can be multiple syntaxes for
expressing the same semantic idea, that is, the same computation.

The semantics of function application is the very heart of OCaml and of
functional programming, and it's something we will come back to several times
throughout the course to deepen our understanding.
