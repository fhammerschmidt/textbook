# If Expressions

The expression `if e1 then e2 else e3` evaluates to `e2` if `e1` evaluates to
`true`, and to `e3` otherwise. We call `e1` the *guard* of the `if` expression.

```
# if 3 + 5 > 2 then "yay!" else "boo!";;
- : string = "yay!"
```

Unlike `if-then-else` *statements* that you may have used in imperative
languages, `if-then-else` *expressions* in OCaml are just like any other
expression; they can be put anywhere an expression can go. That makes them
similar to the ternary operator `? :` that you might have used in other
languages.

```
# 4 + (if 'a' = 'b' then 1 else 2);;
- : int = 6
```

`If` expressions can be nested in a pleasant way:

```
if e1 then e2
else if e3 then e4
else if e5 then e6
...
else en
```

You should regard the final `else` as mandatory, regardless of whether you are
writing a single `if` expression or a highly nested `if` expression. If you
omit it you'll likely get an error message that, for now, is inscrutable:

```
# if 2>3 then 5;;
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type unit
```
 

**Syntax.** The syntax of an `if` expression:
```
if e1 then e2 else e3
```
The letter `e` is used here to represent any other OCaml expression; it's an
example of a *syntactic variable* aka *metavariable*, which is not actually
a variable in the OCaml language itself, but instead a name for a certain
syntactic construct.  The numbers after the letter `e` are being used
to distinguish the three different occurrences of it.

**Dynamic semantics.**
The dynamic semantics of an `if` expression:

* if `e1` evaluates to `true`, and if `e2` evaluates to a value `v`, 
  then `if e1 then e2 else e3` evaluates to `v`

* if `e1` evaluates to `false`, and if `e3` evaluates to a value `v`, 
  then `if e1 then e2 else e3` evaluates to `v`.

We call these *evaluation rules*: they define how to evaluate expressions. Note
how it takes two rules to describe the evaluation of an `if` expression, one for
when the guard is true, and one for when the guard is false. The letter `v` is
used here to represent any OCaml value; it's another example of a metavariable.
Later we will develop a more mathematical way of expressing dynamic semantics,
but for now we'll stick with this more informal style of explanation.

**Static semantics.** The static semantics of an `if` expression:

* if `e1` has type `bool` and `e2` has type `t` and `e3` has type `t` 
  then `if e1 then e2 else e3` has type `t`
  
We call this a *typing rule*: it describes how to type check an expression. Note
how it only takes one rule to describe the type checking of an `if` expression.
At compile time, when type checking is done, it makes no difference whether the
guard is true or false; in fact, there's no way for the compiler to know what
value the guard will have at run time. The letter `t` here is used to represent
any OCaml type; the OCaml manual also has definition of [all types][types]
(which curiously does not name the base types of the language like `int` and
`bool`).

We're going to be writing "has type" a lot, so let's introduce a more compact
notation for it.  Whenever we would write "`e` has type `t`", let's instead
write `e : t`.  The colon is pronounced "has type".  This usage of colon
is consistent with how the toplevel responds after it evaluates an expression
that you enter:
```
# let x = 42;;
val x : int = 42
```
In the above example, variable `x` has type `int`, which is what the colon
indicates.
