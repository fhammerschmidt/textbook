# Currying

We've already seen that an OCaml function that takes two arguments of types
`t1` and `t2` and returns a value of type `t3` has the type `t1 -> t2 -> t3`.
We use two variables after the function name in the let expression:

```
# let add x y = x + y;;
val add : int -> int -> int
```

Another way to define a function that takes two arguments is to write a function
that takes a tuple:

```
# let add' t = (fst t) + (snd t)
val add' : int * int -> int
```

Instead of using `fst` and `snd`, we could use a tuple pattern in the 
definition of the function, leading to a third implementation:

```
# let add'' (x,y) = x + y
val add'' : int * int -> int
```

Functions written using the first style (with type `t1 -> t2 -> t3`) are
called *curried* functions, and functions using the second style (with
type `t1 * t2 -> t3`) are called *uncurried*.  Metaphorically, curried
functions are "spicier" because you can partially apply them (something
you can't do with uncurried functions: you can't pass in half of a
pair).  Actually, the term curry does not refer to spices, but to a
logician named [Haskell Curry][curry] (one of a very small set of people
with programming languages named after both their first and last names).

Sometimes you will come across libraries that offer an uncurried version
of a function, but you want a curried version of it to use in your own
code; or vice versa.  So it is useful to know how to convert between
the two kinds of functions.
