# OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful

**Fall 2021 Edition**

A textbook on functional programming and data structures in OCaml, with an
emphasis on semantics and software engineering.

Based on courses taught by Michael R. Clarkson, Robert L. Constable,
Nate Foster, Michael D. George, Dan Grossman, Daniel P. Huttenlocher,
Dexter Kozen, Greg Morrisett, Andrew C. Myers, Radu Rugina, and Ramin
Zabih.

This work is based on over 20 years worth of course notes and intellectual
contributions by the authors named above; teasing out who contributed
what is, by now, not an easy task. The primary compiler and author of
this work in its form as a unified textbook is Michael R. Clarkson.

<!-- The link in the next paragraph apparently needs to be in a raw block.
Otherwise, Sphinx notices that the target doesn't actually exist at
build time, and issues an error about a bad cross-reference.-->
